## Fixing the UX disaster of Firefox right click contextual menus

#### More features = More better
Firefox seems to fall for this user interace trap *a lot* - modal contextual menus are packed with all kinds of options, all of which change based on the context of the right click. The page right-click is the worst offender by far, packing in *four* redundant navigation controls into one menu item line, before adding all other contols already available in the tab controls.

The problem is that about 99% percent of contextual menu interaction is in the form of right clicking a link to open in a new tab (assuming your other hand isn't near the keyboard)
