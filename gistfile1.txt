## More features = More better
Firefox seems to fall for this user interace trap *a lot* - modal contextual menus are packed with all kinds of options, all of which change based on the context of the right click. The page right-click is the worst offender by far, packing in *four* redundant navigation controls into one menu item line, before adding all other contols already available in the tab controls.
